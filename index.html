            Although mathematics became more and more abstract and general
            throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was
            the greatest master of this trend. His unique skill was to eliminate
            all unnecessary hypotheses and burrow into an area so deeply that
            its inner patterns on the most abstract level revealed themselves --
            and then, like a magician, show how the solution of old problems
            fell out in straightforward ways now that their real nature had been
            revealed. His strength and intensity were legendary. He worked long
            hours, transforming totally the field of algebraic geometry and its
            connections with algebraic number theory. He was considered by many
            the greatest mathematician of the 20th century.

            <li>
              <strong>1928-1933</strong>
              Alexander Grothendieck was born on 28 March 1928 in Berlin, where
              he lived with his parents Johanna Grothendieck and Alexander
              Schapiro, and his sister Maidi (Hanka's daughter from an earlier
              marriage). His father worked as a street photographer, one of the
              only jobs his anarchist beliefs allowed him, and his mother as a
              journalist.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1933-1939</strong>
              Grothendieck parents leaved Berlin for Paris to evade Nazism,
              leaving Grothendieck with a foster family, the Heydorns, in
              Hamburg. There he went to school and then Gymnasium, while his
              parents took part in the Spanish civil war.

              <strong>1939-1942</strong>
              Due to the incoming war, foster mother sent Grothendieck to his
              parents in France. Grothendieck and his mother are interned in
              Rieucros Camp as "undesirable" while his father is sent to Le
              Vernet, later being sent to Auschwitz where he died.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1942-1945</strong>
              His mother is sent to Gurs while he is permitted to live in the
              village Le Chambon sur Lignon. There he attended the famous
              Collège-Lyceé Cévénol through his baccalauréat, where he first
              became fascinated with mathematics.

            <li>
              <strong>1945-1949</strong>
              After the war, Grothendieck and his mother moved to a small
              village near Montpellier where he worked on a farm while studying
              mathematics at the University of Montpellier. After graduating in
              1948, he went to Paris where he took several courses and met most
              of the famous mathematicians of the time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1949-1953</strong>
              Grothendieck worked on his doctorate under the supervision of
              Laurent Schwartz, introducing new concepts and obtaining several
              results in the area of functional analysis. By the end of his
              doctorate he was considered one of the leading figures in the
              area.

            <li>
              <strong>1953-1958</strong>
              After he doctorated, Grothendieck worked as a visiting researcher
              at the University of São Paulo, University of Kansas in Lawrence
              and CNRS. In this period he migrated from functionl analysis to
              algebraic geometry, publishing revolutionary works on homologiacal
              algebra and the proof of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1958-1970</strong>
              The IHES is created in order for Grothendieck to have a research
              position there. During the twelve years he spent there, he
              completely renewed the theory of algebraic geometry, writing
              Éléments de Géométrie Algébrique (with Dieudonné) and Séminaire de
              Géométrie Algébrique (with his students). It is during this time,
              in 1966, that he is awarded the Fields Medal, however, for
              political reasons, he refused to travel to Moscow for the
              ceremony.

              <strong>1970-1973</strong>
              Suddenly, on discovering that the IHES is partly funded by the
              miltary, Grothendieck left the institute. He became acutely
              interested in ecological causes and founded the group Survivre et
              Vivre.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1973-1980</strong>
              Grothendieck accepted a professorship at the University of
              Montpellier. There he lectured and had some graduate students, but
              got discouraged by the teaching situation and became increasingly
              estranged from the mathematical community. It was during this time
              that he started meditating.

              <strong>1980-1988</strong>
              During this period, Grothendieck wrote thousands of pages of
              mathematical and non-mathematical meditations. In 1984, he applied
              for a temporary position with the CNRS with his proposal for
              research Esquisse d'un Programme, a program that continues to date
              to be of major interest in several branches of advanced
              mathematics. In 1988, Grothendieck was awarded (with his student
              Pierre Deligne) the Crafoord Prize, but refused it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1988-2014</strong>
              Grothendieck officially retired on January 10, 1988. Later, in
              1991, he left his home for an unknown location. He spent his time
              writing an enormous work on physics and philosophical meditations
              on themes such as free choice, determinism and the existence of
              evil. On 13 November 2014, aged 86, Grothendieck died in the
              hospital of Saint-Girons, Ariège.
