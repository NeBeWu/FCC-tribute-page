        <h3 id="headline">Here is a time line of Alexander Gronthendieck's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1928</strong>
            Born on 28 March 1928 in Berlin. His parents were Johanna "Hanka" Grothendieck and Alexander "Sascha"
            Schapiro. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1928-1933</strong>
            Lives together with his parents and Hanka's daughter Frode (called Maidi, born 1924 from an earlier marriage)
            in Berlin. Sascha works as a street photographer, one of the only jobs his anarchist beliefs allow him,
            Hanka works irregularly as a journalist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1933</strong>
            Alexander's parents leave Berlin for Paris, leaving Alexander with a foster family, the Heydorns, in Hamburg.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1934-1939</strong>
            Lives with the Heydorns in Hamburg-Blankenese, goes to school there and then to Gymnasium. During this time,
            Sascha und Hanka take part in the Spanish civil war and return disillusioned; Hanka finds work in Nîmes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1939</strong>
            Alexander's foster mother decides that given the political situation and her own family's dangerous
            involvement with the Resistance, it would be safer for him to be sent to join his parents in France. She
            locates the parents and sends him away by train. He first joins his father, then spends the summer with his
            mother in Nîmes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1940-1942</strong>
            Hanka is interned, as an "undesirable" (German), in the Rieucros Camp near Mende, together with Alexander.
            From there, he goes to school in the village four or five kilometers distant. During this time Sascha is
            interned in the camp of Le Vernet, from which he is deported to Auschwitz in 1942.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942-1944</strong>
            The Rieucros camp is dissolved, the inmates are transferred to Gurs. Alexander is sent to the village Le
            Chambon sur Lignon, and attends the famous Collège-Lycée Cévénol through his baccalauréat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945-1948</strong>
            Grothendieck and his mother move to a small village near Montpellier; he works irregularly on a farm while
            studying mathematics at the university of Montpellier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1948/1949</strong>
            Having obtained his degree, Grothendieck goes to Paris in view of obtaining a doctorate. He takes several
            courses and meets most of the famous mathematicians of the time, above all Henri Cartan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1949-1953</strong>
            Cartan advises Grothendieck to do his doctorate in Nancy with Laurent Schwartz. He goes there and finishes
            his doctorate within two years, finding a new topology on tensor products of topological vector spaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1953/1954</strong>
            Grothendieck spends time in Sao Paulo in Brazil, teaching topological vector spaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1955</strong>
            Grothendieck spends part of the year at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, then visits Chicago.
            He hopes to find a position in France, has difficulties however because of his foreign nationality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1959-1970</strong>
            The IHES is created in Bures-sur-Yvette, in order for Grothendieck to have a research position there.
            During the twelve years he spends there, he completely renews the theory of algebraic geometry, writing EGA
            Éléments de Géométrie Algébrique (with Dieudonné) and SGA Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique (with his
            students).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1966</strong>
            At the International Congress of Mathematicians in Moscow, Grothendieck receives the Fields Medal. However,
            for political reasons, he refuses to travel to Moscow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970</strong>
            Suddenly, on discovering that the IHES is partly funded by the miltary, Grothendieck leaves the institute.
            He becomes acutely interested in ecological causes and founds the group Survivre et Vivre.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970-1973</strong>
            For two years, Grothendieck has a temporary post at the Collège de France in Paris, but he uses many of his
            lectures to talk about issues of ecology and peace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1973</strong>
            Grothendieck accepts a professorship at the University of Montpellier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1973-1984</strong>
            Grothendieck lectures and has some graduate students in Montpellier. Until 1980, he lives in Villecun near
            Lodeve, then in Mormoiron near Carpentras.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984-1988</strong>
            Discouraged by the teaching situation, Grothendieck applies for a temporary position with the CNRS for the
            remaining years before his retirement. His research statement for this application is Esquisse d'un
            Programme. From 1983 to 1985 he writes Recoltes et Semailles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980-1990</strong>
            During these years, Grothendieck writes thousands of pages of mathematical and non-mathematical
            meditations. His mathematical manuscripts are La longue marche à travers la théorie de Galois, (1981), A la
            poursuite des champs (1983), Esquisse d´un programme (1983), Les dérivateurs (1987); the non-mathematical
            works are the Eloge (1981, lost?), Récoltes et Semailles (1983-85), La clef des songes (1986).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1988</strong>
            Grothendieck is awarded the Crafoord Prize jointly with Deligne, but refuses it. He retires officially on
            January 10, 1988.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1991</strong>
            In August, Grothendieck leaves his home suddenly, without warning anyone, for an unknown location. He
            spends his time writing an enormous work on physics and philosophical meditations on themes such as free
            choice, determinism and the existence of evil. He refuses practically every human contact.
          </li>
          <li>

            Dies on 13 November 2014 in Saint-Lizier, France.
